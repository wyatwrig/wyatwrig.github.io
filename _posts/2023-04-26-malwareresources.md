This is a list of the main resources that I've been using to learn about malware and malware analysis. 

## Books

This book list is arranged in descending order by scope. It begins with a broad introduction to malware and malware analysis before diving deeper into specific tools and languages. I will update the list with my impressions of each book as I finish it.
